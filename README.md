How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
I believe the first way to begin with this is to communicate with the party involve. Everything begins with understanding the issue that the user wants to solved. This involve asking quesations. Making sure those answers are clarifed, observe workflows, and most importantly identify pain points. Understanding the needs is the tough part to be honest. After everything have been clear to you, clear the requirement into a clear requirement that can be coded into some form of solution. Also, creating users stories helps greatly. 


How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
When developing some form of program it is good to plan small steps. Breaking those big goals into small steps helps to get the ball running fast. Test frequently, those functions need to be validated as you gop along. this will save time and money. You may wnat to incorporate Kanban, or other tools. Kanban shows the task on a board that everyone can see. This visualization helps manage the overall flow. 


What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
To be a good member on a team, not just on a software team, you will need to communicate. keep team informed, asking questions when there is an issue helps. Being able to collaborate helps also. giving feedbacks helping other solve issues, and respecting different views helps also. One of the under rated attribute to being a good team mamber is accountability. Owning up to issues and and being respecful and clear in accepting any blowback helps the team and you individually.
